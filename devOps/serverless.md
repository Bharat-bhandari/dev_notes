## Serverless Architecture

- Serverless architecture is a cloud computing execution model where the cloud provider dynamically manages the infrastructure and allocates resources to run your applications. This approach allows developers to focus on writing code without worrying about server provisioning, scaling, or maintenance.

- The cloud provider (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud) handles provisioning, scaling, and maintenance.
