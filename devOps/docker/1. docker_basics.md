## Why Docker

Docker/containers are important for a few reasons -\

1. Kubernetes/Container orchestration
2. Running processes in isolated environments
3. Starting projects/auxilary services locally

- Container -> A mini machine
- Docker -> Container runtime
- I can give the same container to mac, linux, windows user, then can run it simple **Same** docker command
- Docker isn't the only way to create containers

## How Docker engine works

### 1. Docker Engine

- Docker Engine is an open-source **containerization** technology that allows developers to package applications into **container**.

### 2. Docker CLI

- The command line interface lets you talk to the **docker engine** and lets you start/stop/list containers.

```sh
docker run -d -p 27017:27017 mongo
```

### 3. Docker registry

- The **docker registry** is how Docker makes money.

- It is similar to **github**, but it lets you push **images** rather than **sourcecode**

## Images Vs Containers

- A Docker image is a lightweight, standalone, executables package that includes everything needed to run a piece of software, including the code, a runtime, libraries, environment variables, and config files.

- A container is a running instance of an image. It encapsulates the application or services and its dependencies, running in an isolated environment
